# Astrophysics-Cosmology-Latex-Notes
Lecture notes for the Astrophysics and Cosmology course at UCO (University of Córdoba). Typeset in LaTeX. Images belong to their respective owners. 
Each chapter is prefaced with an image from NASA's 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' (APOD) project. These images are used for educational purposes, and authorship belongs to the photographers and institutions credited by NASA in each case.

These notes were developed with the invaluable guidance of Professor Antonio José Cuesta Vázquez. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for his mentorship throughout the 2025/2026 academic year.

#  Contents 
The PDF document is organized into six chapters, covering everything from observational techniques to theoretical cosmological models:

1. **Positional Astronomy**. An introduction to the celestial sphere and fundamental definitions. This chapter explores various coordinate systems (Horizontal, Equatorial, and Ecliptic) and provides a rigorous derivation of the transformation equations between them.

2. The **Two-Body Problem.** An in-depth study of the two-body problem, including the formal proof of **Kepler’s three laws.** It introduces **effective potential diagram**s as a fundamental analytical tool used to study orbital stability, applicable across various branches of Physics.

3. **Radiation and Photometry**. This chapter focuses on **radiation**, establishing fundamental definitions and introducing the concepts of stellar magnitude and luminosity. It also explores the different types of photometric filters and the effects of atmospheric attenuation on observations.

4.  **Binary Star Systems**. Applying the tools previously developed to provide a comprehensive study of binary stars. Various systems are analyzed using the **Doppler effect** as a key diagnostic tool to characterize orbital parameters and stellar masses
  
5.   **Stellar Physics and Evolution.** An exploration of **Stellar Interiors** using approximate ODE resolution methods to determine the order of magnitude of physical variables inside a star. The chapter also covers the stages of Stellar Evolution and provides a detailed study of **White Dwarfs**, focusing on electron degeneracy pressure and the **Chandrasekhar limit.**

6. **Newtonian Cosmology**. A foundational approach to the expansion of the universe. It begins by explaining Hubble's Law and the Hubble parameter ($H$). Building on these concepts, it introduces Newtonian Cosmology to derive the **Friedmann equation** and model the evolution of an **Einstein-de Sitter universe**.
