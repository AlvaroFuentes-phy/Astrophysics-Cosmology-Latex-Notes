# Astrophysics-Cosmology-Latex-Notes
Lecture notes for the Astrophysics and Cosmology course at UCO (University of Córdoba). Typeset in LaTeX. Images belong to their respective owners. 
Each chapter is prefaced with an image from NASA's 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' (APOD) project. These images are used for educational purposes, and authorship belongs to the photographers and institutions credited by NASA in each case.

These notes were developed with the invaluable guidance of Professor Antonio José Cuesta Vázquez. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for his mentorship throughout the 2025/2026 academic year.
